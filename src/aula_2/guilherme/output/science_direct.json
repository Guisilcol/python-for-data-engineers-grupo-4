This is mainly because Big Data is not only about data, but also about a complete conceptual and technological stack including raw and processed data, storage, ways of managing data, processing and analytics. A challenge that becomes even trickier is the management of the quality of the data in Big Data environments. More than ever before the need for assessing the Quality-in-Use gains importance since the real contribution\u2013business value\u2013of data can be only estimated in its context of use. Although there exists different Data Quality models for assessing the quality of regular data, none of them has been adapted to Big Data. To fill this gap, we propose the \u201c3As Data Quality-in-Use model\u201d, which is composed of three Data Quality characteristics for assessing the levels of Data Quality-in-Use in Big Data projects: Contextual Adequacy, Operational Adequacy and Temporal Adequacy. The model can be integrated into any sort of Big Data project, as it is independent of any pre-conditions or technologies. The paper shows the way to use the model with a working example. The model accomplishes every challenge related to Data Quality program aimed for Big Data. The main conclusion is that the model can be used as an appropriate way to obtain the Quality-in-Use levels of the input data of the Big Data analysis, and those levels can be understood as indicators of trustworthiness and soundness of the results of the Big Data analysis.","year":"2016","ENTRYTYPE":"article","doi":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.future.2015.11.024"},{"author":"Simon Vydra and Bram Klievink","title":"Techno-optimism and policy-pessimism in the public sector big data debate","keywords":"Big data, Analytics, Government, Public administration, Policy-making, Decision-making, Science-policy interface, Network governance","abstract":"Despite great potential, high hopes and big promises, the actual impact of big data on the public sector is not always as transformative as the literature would suggest.

However, before the data can be used its quality must be determined and appropriate regions extracted. Initially, such testing was done manually using graphs or basic rules, such as the value of a variable. With large data sets, such an approach will not work, since the amount of data to tested and the number of potential rules is too large. Therefore, there is a need for automated segmentation of the data set into different components. Such an approach has recently been proposed and tested using various types of industrial data. Although the industrial results are promising, there still remain many unanswered questions including how to handle a priori knowledge, over- or undersegmentation of the data set, and setting the appropriate thresholds for a given application. Solving these problems will provide a robust and reliable method for determining the data quality of a given data set.","year":"2020","ENTRYTYPE":"article","doi":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ifacol.2020.12.103"},{"author":"Jia Liu and Tianrui Li and Peng Xie and Shengdong Du and Fei Teng and Xin Yang","title":"Urban big data fusion based on deep learning: An overview","keywords":"Urban computing, Big data, Data fusion, Deep learning","abstract":"Urban big data fusion creates huge values for urban computing in solving urban problems.

Therefore, many firms defer collecting and integrating big data as they have concerns regarding the impact of utilizing big data on data diagnosticity (i.e., retrieval of valuable information from data) and firm decision making quality. In this study, we use the Organizational Learning Theory and Wang and Strong's data quality framework to explore the impact of processing big data on firm decision quality and the mediating role of data quality (DQ) and data diagnosticity on this relationship. We validate the proposed research model using survey data from 130 firms, obtained from data analysts and IT managers. Results confirm the critical role of DQ in increasing data diagnosticity and improving firm decision quality when processing big data; suggesting important implications for practice and theory. Findings also reveal that while big data utilization positively impacts contextual DQ, accessibility DQ, and representational DQ, interestingly, it negatively impacts intrinsic DQ. Furthermore, findings show that while intrinsic DQ, contextual DQ, and representational DQ significantly increase data diagnosticity, accessibility DQ does not influence it. Most importantly, the findings show that big data utilization does not significantly impact the quality of firm decisions and it is fully mediated through DQ and data diagnosticity. The results of this study contribute to practice by providing important guidelines for managers to improve firm decision quality through the use of big data.","year":"2019","ENTRYTYPE":"article","doi":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.dss.2019.03.008"},{"author":"Giorgia Carra and Jorge I.F.

However, a major challenge that needs to be addressed, and often is ignored in the literature, concerns reliability. Actually, data is agglomerated from multiple disparate sources, and each of Knowledge Discovery (KDD) process steps may be carried out by different organizations.

We focus on Linked Open Data (LOD) as a source of data, as it constitutes a relevant data provider in many Big Data applications. However, our framework can also be adapted for unstructured data.

In the digital and computing world, information is generated and collected at a rate that quickly exceeds the boundaries. The traditional data integration system interconnects the limited number of resources and is built with relatively stable and generally complex and time-consuming design activities. However, the rapid growth of these large data sets creates difficulties in learning heterogeneous data structures for integration and indexing. It also creates difficulty in information retrieval for the various data analysis requirements. In this paper, a probabilistic feature Patterns (PFP) approach using feature transformation and selection method is proposed for efficient data integration and utilizing the features latent semantic analysis (F-LSA) method for indexing the unsupervised multiple heterogeneous integrated cluster data sources. The PFP approach takes the advantage of the features transformation and selection mechanism to map and cluster the data for the integration, and an analysis of the data features context relation using LSA to provide the appropriate index for fast and accurate data extraction. A huge volume of BibText dataset from different publication sources are processed to evaluated to understand the effectiveness of the proposal. The analytical study and the outcome results show the improvisation in integration and indexing of the work.","year":"2020","ENTRYTYPE":"article","doi":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.array.2020.100033"},{"author":"Linlin Zhao and Heather L.

However, much recent work on big data in public decision-making assumes a rational view of decision-making, which has been much criticized in the public administration debate. In this paper, we apply this view, and a more political one, to the context of big data and offer a qualitative study. We question the impact of big data on decision-making, realizing that big data \u2013 including its new methods and functions \u2013 must inevitably encounter existing political and managerial institutions. By studying two illustrative cases of big data use processes, we explore how these two worlds meet. Specifically, we look at the interaction between data analysts and decision makers. In this we distinguish between a rational view and a political view, and between an information logic and a decision logic. We find that big data provides ample opportunities for both analysts and decision makers to do a better job, but this doesn't necessarily imply better decision-making, because big data also provides opportunities for actors to pursue their own interests. Big data enables both data analysts and decision makers to act as autonomous agents rather than as links in a functional chain. Therefore, big data's impact cannot be interpreted only in terms of its functional promise; it must also be acknowledged as a phenomenon set to impact our policymaking institutions, including their legitimacy.","year":"2019","ENTRYTYPE":"article","doi":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.giq.2018.10.011"},{"author":"Patrick Mikalef and John Krogstie and Ilias O.

By means of partial least squares structural equation modeling, results show that a strong BDAC can help firms build a competitive advantage. This effect is not direct but fully mediated by dynamic capabilities, which exerts a positive and significant effect on two types of operational capabilities: marketing and technological capabilities.

Consequently, drought monitoring using big data analytic has gained an explosive interest. Droughts stand among the most damaging natural disasters. It threatens agricultural production, ecological environment, and socio-economic development. For this reason, early warning, accurate evaluation, and efficient prediction are an emergency especially for the nations that are the most menaced by this danger. There are numerous emerging studies addressing big data and its applications in drought monitoring. In fact, big data handle data heterogeneity which is an additive value for the prediction of drought, it offers a view of the different dimensions such as the spatial distribution, the temporal distribution and the severity detection of this phenomenon. Big data analytic and drought are introduced and reviewed in this paper. Besides, this review includes different studies, researches and applications of big data to drought monitoring.

The results of the questionnaire show that the probability of data analysis, medical treatment process, disease diagnosis process, lack of protective measures, and imperfect access system is all greater than 0.8 when medical care big data is oriented to cloud services. Based on this, two levels of privacy protection measures are proposed: technology and management. It indicates that medical institutions need to pay attention to data privacy protection and grasp the use of digital medical data to provide decision support for subsequent medical data analysis.","year":"2020","ENTRYTYPE":"article","doi":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.future.2020.03.039"},{"author":"Emily L.

However, critical user experience issues such as crowding discomfort and travel time unreliability are still not considered in those accessibility indicators. This paper aims to apply a methodology to build spatiotemporal crowding data and estimate travel time variability in a congested public transport network to improve accessibility calculations. It relies on using multiple big data sources available in most transit systems such as smart card and automatic vehicle location (AVL) data. S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, is used as a case study to show the impact of crowding and travel time variability on accessibility to jobs. Our results evidence a population-weighted average reduction of 56.8% in accessibility to jobs in a regular workday morning peak due to crowding discomfort, as well as reductions of 6.2% due to travel time unreliability and 59.2% when both are combined. The findings of this study can be of invaluable help to public transport planners and policymakers, as they show the importance of including both aspects in accessibility indicators for better decision making.

Companies, based on the field of activity, decide to strengthen some of their capabilities, capacities, and expertise. Therefore, the focus of an organization on the strengths and efforts to develop its sustainability will lead to a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Due to changes in environmental factors, organizations have focused on carbon emissions in procurement and transportation that have the highest carbon footprint. This paper proposes a multi-objective, eco-sustainability model for a supply chain. The objectives are to minimize overall costs, maximize the efficiency of transportation vehicles and minimize information fraud in the process of information sharing within supply chain elements. Big data is considered in the amount of information exchanged between customers and other elements of the proposed supply chain; since there are frauds in information sharing then using big data 5Vs the model is adapted to control the cost of information loss leading to customer dissatisfaction. Since uncertainty is inevitable in the real environments, in this research hybrid uncertainty is considered. Because two sources of uncertainty are considered in most of the parameters, thus it is necessary to robustify the decision-making process. The model is a mixed integer nonlinear program including big data for an optimal sustainable procurement and transportation decision. A heuristic method is used to solve the big data problem that makes use of a robust fuzzy stochastic programming approach. The proposed model can prevent disturbances by using a scenario-based stochastic programming approach. An effective hybrid robust fuzzy stochastic method is also employed for controlling uncertainty in parameters and risk taking out of outbound decisions. To solve the multi-objective model, augmented \u03b5-constraint method is utilized. The model performance is investigated in a comprehensive computational study.","year":"2020","ENTRYTYPE":"article","doi":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jclepro.2020.120640"},{"author":"Ashish Kumar Jha and Maher A.N.

IoT is a vision that allows things or objects equipped with sensors, actuators, and processors to talk and communicate with each other over the internet to achieve a meaningful goal. Unfortunately, one of the major challenges that affect IoT is data quality and uncertainty, as data volume increases noise, inconsistency and redundancy increases within data and causes paramount issues for IoT technologies. And since IoT is considered to be a massive quantity of heterogeneous networked embedded devices that generate big data, then it is very complex to compute and analyze such massive data. So this paper introduces a new model named NRDD-DBSCAN based on DBSCAN algorithm and using resilient distributed datasets (RDDs) to detect outliers that affect the data quality of IoT technologies. NRDD-DBSCAN has been applied on three different datasets of N-dimensions (2-D, 3-D, and 25-D) and the results were promising. Finally, comparisons have been made between NRDD-DBSCAN and previous models such as RDD-DBSCAN model and DBSCAN algorithm, and these comparisons proved that NRDD-DBSCAN solved the low dimensionality issue of RDD-DBSCAN model and also solved the fact that DBSCAN algorithm cannot handle IoT data. So the conclusion is that NRDD-DBSCAN proposed model can detect the outliers that exist in the datasets of N-dimensions by using resilient distributed datasets (RDDs), and NRDD-DBSCAN can enhance the quality of data exists in IoT applications and technologies.","year":"2020","ENTRYTYPE":"article","doi":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.eij.2019.12.001"},{"author":"Patrick Mikalef and Maria Boura and George Lekakos and John Krogstie","title":"The role of information governance in big data analytics driven innovation","keywords":"Big data analytics capabilities, Information governance, Incremental innovation, Radical innovation, Environmental uncertainty, FIMIX-PLS","abstract":"The age of big data analytics is now here, with companies increasingly investing in big data initiatives to foster innovation and outperform competition. Nevertheless, while researchers and practitioners started to examine the shifts that these technologies entail and their overall business value, it is still unclear whether and under what conditions they drive innovation.

Accordingly, there is a need for rigorous academic guidance on what factors enable effective use of big data. With this paper, we aim to guide IS researchers such that the expansion of the body of knowledge on the effective use of big data can proceed in a structured and systematic manner and can subsequently lead to empirically driven guidance for organizations. Namely, with this paper, we cast a wide net to understand and consolidate from literature the potential factors that can influence the effective use of big data, so they may be further studied. To do so, we first conduct a systematic literature review. Our review identifies 41 factors, which we categorize into 7 themes, namely data quality; data privacy and security and governance; perceived organizational benefit; process management; people aspects; systems, tools, and technologies; and organizational aspects. To explore the existence of these themes in practice, we then analyze 45 published case studies that document insights into how specific companies use big data successfully. Finally, we propose a framework for the study of effective use of big data as a basis for future research. Our contributions aim to guide researchers in establishing the relevance and relationships within the identified themes and factors and are a step toward developing a deeper understanding of effective use of big data.","year":"2020","ENTRYTYPE":"article","doi":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.im.2019.02.001"},{"author":"Fakhitah Ridzuan and Wan Mohd Nazmee {Wan Zainon}","title":"A Review on Data Cleansing Methods for Big Data","keywords":"data cleansing, big data, data quality","abstract":"Massive amounts of data are available for the organization which will influence their business decision.

Nevertheless, the users of machine learning usually find that these sophisticated techniques could incur a high level of tensions caused by the selection of the appropriate size of the training data set among other factors. In this paper, we provide a systematic way of resolving such tensions by examining practical examples of predicting popularity and sentiment of posts on Twitter and Facebook, blogs on Mashable, news on Google and Yahoo, the US house survey, and Bitcoin prices. Interesting results show that for the case of big data, using around 20% of the full sample often leads to a better prediction accuracy than opting for the full sample. Our conclusion is found to be consistent across a series of experiments.

Despite the growing number of firms that are launching big data initiatives, there is still limited understanding on how firms translate the potential of such technologies into business value. The literature argues that to leverage big data analytics and realize performance gains, firms must develop strong big data analytics capabilities. Nevertheless, most studies operate under the assumption that there is limited heterogeneity in the way firms build their big data analytics capabilities and that related resources are of similar importance regardless of context. This paper draws on complexity theory and investigates the configurations of resources and contextual factors that lead to performance gains from big data analytics investments. Our empirical investigation followed a mixed methods approach using survey data from 175 chief information officers and IT managers working in Greek firms, and three case studies to show that depending on the context, big data analytics resources differ in significance when considering performance gains. Applying a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) method on the quantitative data, we show that there are four different patterns of elements surrounding big data analytics that lead to high performance. Outcomes of the three case studies highlight the inter-relationships between these elements and outline challenges that organizations face when orchestrating big data analytics resources.","year":"2019","ENTRYTYPE":"article","doi":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jbusres.2019.01.044"},{"author":"Michael R.

As a branch of scientific research, production safety management is also exploring methods to take advantage of big data. This research aims to provide a theoretical basis for promoting the application of big data in production safety management. First, four different types of production safety management paradigms were identified, namely small-data-based, static-oriented, interpretation-based and causal-oriented paradigm, and the challenges to these paradigms in the presence of big data were introduced. Second, the opportunities of employing big data in production safety management were identified from four aspects, including better predict the future production safety phenomena, promote production safety management highlight relevance, achieve the balance between deductive and inductive approaches and promote the interdisciplinary development of production safety management. Third, the paradigm shifting trend of production safety management was concluded, and the discipline foundation of the new paradigm was considered as the integration of data science, production management and safety science. Fourth, a new big-data-driven production safety management paradigm was developed, which consists of the logical line of production safety management, the macro-meso-micro data spectrum, the key big data analytics, and the four-dimensional morphology.

Big data processing has been combined with service and cloud computing, leading to a new class of services called \u201cBig Services\u201d. In this new model, services can be seen as an abstract layer that hides the complexity of the processed big data. To meet users' complex and heterogeneous needs in the era of big data, service reuse is a natural and efficient means that helps orchestrating available services' operations, to provide customer on-demand big services. However different from traditional Web service composition, composing big services refers to the reuse of, not only existing high-quality services, but also high-quality data sources, while taking into account their security constraints (e.g., data provenance, threat level and data leakage). Moreover, composing heterogeneous and large-scale data-centric services faces several challenges, apart from security risks, such as the big services' high execution time and the incompatibility between providers' policies across multiple domains and clouds. Aiming to solve the above issues, we propose a scalable approach for big service composition, which considers not only the quality of reused services (QoS), but also the quality of their consumed data sources (QoD). Since the correct representation of big services requirements is the first step towards an effective composition, we first propose a quality model for big services and we quantify the data breaches using L-Severity metrics. Then to facilitate processing and mining big services' related information during composition, we exploit the strong mathematical foundation of fuzzy Relational Concept Analysis (fuzzy RCA) to build the big services' repository as a lattice family. We also used fuzzy RCA to cluster services and data sources based on various criteria, including their quality levels, their domains, and the relationships between them. Finally, we define algorithms that parse the lattice family to select and compose high-quality and secure big services in a parallel fashion. The proposed method, which is implemented on top of Spark big data framework, is compared with two existing approaches, and experimental studies proved the effectiveness of our big service composition approach in terms of QoD-aware composition, scalability, and security breaches.","year":"2020","ENTRYTYPE":"article","doi":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jnca.2020.102732"},{"author":"Pan Liu and Yue Long and Hai-Cao Song and Yan-Dong He","title":"Investment decision and coordination of green agri-food supply chain considering information service based on blockchain and big data","keywords":"Big data, Blockchain, Agri-food supply chain, Investment decision, Coordination","abstract":"Researches about the fusion application of Big Data and blockchain have appeared for a long time, many information service providers have launched information service business based on Big Data and blockchain (hereafter, ISBD).

A vital reason is that many decision makers do not know how to make an optimal investment decision and coordinate chain members after adopting ISBD. The core of this problem is to study the issue of investment decision and coordination in a green agri-food supply chain. To solve this problem, firstly, combining with the status of Chinese agricultural development, we proposed a more suitable supply chain structure in the fusion application environment of Big Data and blockchain. Then, we chose a green agri-food supply chain with one producer and one retailer as research object and revised the demand function. Afterwards, considering the changes of agri-food freshness and greenness, we built and analysed the benefit models of producer and retailer before and after using ISBD, and then a cost-sharing and revenue-sharing contract was put forward to coordinate the supply chain. Findings: 1) When the total investment cost payed by producer and retailer is in a certain range, using ISBD will help chain members gain more benefits. 2) If chain members want to gain more benefits after using ISBD, they should try their best to optimize costs by extracting valuable information.

This study explores the impact of technological innovation, Big Data marketing and overconfidence on supply chain member decision-making. We propose a two-stage remanufacturing CLSC dynamic model consisting of a manufacturer, an IRP, and a supplier based on differential game theory. By comparing the optimal decisions of each member in three scenarios, we find that the IRP\u2019s overconfident behavior is beneficial to both the manufacturer and the IRP but will damage the supplier's profit. Although a suitable cost-sharing ratio can enable the manufacturer and IRP to achieve a \u201cwin\u2013win\u201d situation, an excessive level of confidence will inhibit the incentives of the cost-sharing strategy, negatively affecting the manufacturer's interests. Interestingly, a cost-sharing contract will become inefficient under certain conditions, i.e., highly efficient level of technological innovation, highly efficient Big Data marketing, and a high level of overconfidence, negatively affecting the manufacturer\u2019s interests. Additionally, technological innovation efficiency and marketing efficiency will have different effects on the IRP's recycling price. A cost-sharing contract and the IRP\u2019s overconfidence will prompt the IRP to exert more efforts on technological innovation and Big Data marketing and to significantly reduce the manufacturing costs and recycling costs for all members.

The aim of this study was to summarize the big data-based UESS research using a systematic review approach in combination with bibliometric and thematic analyses. The results showed that the numbers of publications and citations of related articles have been increasing exponentially in recent years. The most frequently used big data in UESS research are human behavior data, and the major analytical methods are of five types: classification, clustering, regression, association rules, and social network analysis. The major research topics of big data-based UESS research include urban mobility, urban land use and planning, environmental sustainability, public health and safety, social equity, tourism, resources and energy utilization, real estate, and retail, accommodation and catering. Big data benefit UESS research by proving a people-oriented perspective, timely and real-time information, and fine-resolution spatial dynamics. In addition, several obstacles were identified to applying big data in UESS research, which are related to data quality and acquisition, data storage and management, data security and privacy, data cleaning and preprocessing, and data analysis and information mining.

The online questionnaire consisted of both standardized, validated questions taken from already tested survey instruments and additional questions which were constructed on the basis of a preceding literature analysis. The evaluation of the survey was primarily descriptive, with a calculation of frequencies, mean values and standard deviations.\nResults\nThe results of the evaluation show that the scenario has been accepted by a majority of all groups surveyed (physicians, patients\/patient representatives, IT experts and health care researchers). From the point of view of physicians, patients\/patient representatives and health care researchers, the scenario has the potential to accelerate the diagnosis and initiation of therapy and to improve cross-sectoral treatment. From the physician\u2019s and health care researcher\u2019s perspective, investments in the application presented in the scenario would be profitable. Financing the scenario would, however, require adjusting the reimbursement situation. The limitations and barriers identified by all groups for a medium-term implementation of the scenario can be grouped into seven thematic areas where action is needed: (1) financing and investment, (2) data protection and data security, (3) standards\/data sources\/data quality, (4) acceptance of technology, (5) integration into the daily work routine, (6) knowledge about availability as well as (7) habits and preferences\/physician's role.\nDiscussion\nWith the present study, a first interdisciplinary, practical scenario using big data applications was evaluated with regard to acceptance, benefits and limitations\/barriers. The scenario is widely accepted among the majority of all surveyed target groups and is considered (clinically) useful, although legal, organisational and technical barriers still need to be overcome for its medium-term implementation. The evaluation results contribute to the derivation of recommendations for action to ensure the medium-term implementation of the scenario and to channel access to the Centres for Rare Diseases in the future.\nConclusion\nMany activities have been initiated at a national level to improve the health care situation of people with rare diseases. The scenario developed in the \u201cBIDA-SE\u201d project complements these research activities and illustrates how big data applications can be usefully implemented into practice to improve the diagnosis and therapy of people with rare diseases in a sustainable way.","year":"2020","ENTRYTYPE":"article","doi":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.zefq.2020.11.002"},{"author":"Elaheh Yadegaridehkordi and Mehrbakhsh Nilashi and Liyana Shuib and Mohd {Hairul Nizam Bin Md Nasir} and Shahla Asadi and Sarminah Samad and Nor {Fatimah Awang}","title":"The impact of big data on firm performance in hotel industry","keywords":"Firm performance, Big data, Hotel industry, Fuzzy logic, Structural equation modelling","abstract":"Big data has increasingly appeared as a frontier of opportunity in enhancing firm performance. However, it still is in early stages of introduction and many enterprises are still un-decisive in its adoption. The aim of this study is to propose a theoretical model based on integration of Human-Organization-Technology fit and Technology-Organization-Environment frameworks to identify the key factors affecting big data adoption and its consequent impact on the firm performance. The significant factors are gained from the literature and the research model is developed. Data was collected from top managers and\/or owners of SMEs hotels in Malaysia using online survey questionnaire. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is used to assess the developed model and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) technique is used to prioritize adoption factors based on their importance levels. The results showed that relative advantage, management support, IT expertise, and external pressure are the most important factors in the technological, organizational, human, and environmental dimensions. The results further revealed that technology is the most important influential dimension. The outcomes of this study can assist the policy makers, businesses and governments to make well-informed decisions in adopting big data.","year":"2020","ENTRYTYPE":"article","doi":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.elerap.2019.100921"},{"author":"Marcello M.

Increasingly, e-commerce platforms are using them to gain insights from customer feedback. Meanwhile, a new generation of big data analytics (BDA) companies are crowdsourcing large volumes of OCRs by means of controlled ad hoc online experiments and advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to forecast demand and determine the market potential for new products in several industries. We illustrate how this process is taking place for consumer goods companies by exploring the case of UK digital BDA company, SoundOut. Based on an in-depth qualitative analysis, we develop the consumer goods company innovation (CGCI) conceptual framework, which illustrates how digital BDA firms help consumer goods companies to test new products before they are launched on the market, and innovate.

By producing intuition, intelligence, and insights, these data have the potential to recast conventional process-driven agriculture, plotting the course for a smarter, data-driven farming. However, many open issues about the use of big data in agriculture remain unanswered. In this work, conceptualizing smart agricultural systems as cyber-physical-social systems, and building upon activity theory, we aim at highlighting some key questions that need to be addressed. To our view, big data constitute a tool reciprocally produced by all the actors involved in the agrifood supply chains. The constant flux of this tool and the intricate nature of the interactions among the actors who share it complicate the translation of big data into value. Moreover, farmers\u2019 limited capacity to deal with data complexity, along with their dual role as producers and users of big data, impedes the institutionalization of this tool at the farm level. Although the approach used left us with more questions than answers, we suggest that unraveling the institutional arrangements that govern value co-creation, capturing the motivations of farmers and other actors, and detailing the direct and indirect effects that big data (and the technologies used to generate them) have in farms are important preconditions for setting forth rules that facilitate the extraction and equal exchange of value from big data.","year":"2019","ENTRYTYPE":"article","doi":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.njas.2019.04.003"},{"author":"Xiang Li and Ning Guo and Quanzheng Li","title":"Functional Neuroimaging in the New Era of Big Data","keywords":"Big data, Neuroimaging, Machine learning, Health informatics, fMRI","abstract":"The field of functional neuroimaging has substantially advanced as a big data science in the past decade, thanks to international collaborative projects and community efforts. Here we conducted a literature review on functional neuroimaging, with focus on three general challenges in big data tasks: data collection and sharing, data infrastructure construction, and data analysis methods. The review covers a wide range of literature types including perspectives, database descriptions, methodology developments, and technical details. We show how each of the challenges was proposed and addressed, and how these solutions formed the three core foundations for the functional neuroimaging as a big data science and helped to build the current data-rich and data-driven community. Furthermore, based on our review of recent literature on the upcoming challenges and opportunities toward future scientific discoveries, we envisioned that the functional neuroimaging community needs to advance from the current foundations to better data integration infrastructure, methodology development toward improved learning capability, and multi-discipline translational research framework for this new era of big data.","year":"2019","ENTRYTYPE":"article","doi":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.gpb.2018.11.005"},{"author":"Ant\u00f3nio A.C.

To avoid them, simulation can be used, allowing the uncertainty of these systems to be considered. Furthermore, the data that is generated at increasingly high volumes, velocities and varieties by relevant data sources allow, on one hand, the simulation model to capture all the relevant elements. While developing such solution, due to the inherent use of simulation, several data issues were identified and bypassed, so that the incorporated elements comprise a coherent SC simulation model. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to present the main issues that were faced, and discuss how these were bypassed, while working on a SC simulation model in a Big Data context and using real industrial data from an automotive electronics SC. This paper highlights the role of simulation in this task, since it worked as a semantic validator of the data. Moreover, this paper also presents the results that can be obtained from the developed model.","year":"2020","ENTRYTYPE":"article","doi":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.promfg.2020.02.033"},{"author":"Todd R.
